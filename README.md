### Introduction

This project is a classic bubble breaker game built on React. While user click on a ball (or a bubble), the game runs the DFS algorithm to find all the other ball that with the same color and connected to it. Once the user click again, the bubbles block wil be eliminated.

This project uses redux to manange the bubble board status. It also implemented the undo function, which allows users to go back one step after they break a bubble block.

I also plan to develop an iOS / Android version using react-native, and a wechat widget version using Taro.
